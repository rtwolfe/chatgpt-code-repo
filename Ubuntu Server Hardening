Certainly! Here's the hardening script for an Ubuntu server with enhanced best practices:

#!/bin/bash

# Update package repositories and upgrade installed packages
apt update
apt upgrade -y

# Enable and configure firewall (UFW) to allow only necessary services
ufw default deny incoming
ufw default allow outgoing
ufw allow ssh
ufw allow http
ufw allow https
ufw --force enable    # The --force option ensures that the firewall is enabled without user interaction

# Install and configure fail2ban for protection against brute-force attacks
apt install fail2ban -y
cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.{conf,local}  # Using a shorter syntax to copy the configuration file
systemctl enable fail2ban
systemctl start fail2ban

# Install and configure unattended-upgrades for automatic security updates
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y unattended-upgrades
dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades

# Disable root login and password authentication
sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin .*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config    # Using a more generic pattern to capture different configurations
sed -i 's/PasswordAuthentication .*/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl restart sshd

# Set password policies
# Implement password complexity requirements, minimum length, expiration, etc.

# Disable unused network services
# systemctl disable <service_name>
# Replace <service_name> with specific services not required

# Implement regular system auditing
# Utilize auditd to monitor and log system changes and user activities

# Configure and monitor system logs
# Set up log rotation, implement centralized logging, and monitor critical logs for security incidents

# Implement strict file permissions and ownership
# Restrict access to sensitive files and directories

# Regular backups and recovery planning
# Implement automated backup solutions and disaster recovery plans

# Security training and awareness
# Provide security training for users and administrators to emphasize best practices

# Continuous monitoring and review of security policies and guidelines
# Regularly review and update security measures to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities

echo "Server hardening completed."


This script serves as a starting point for hardening an Ubuntu server. When using this script, be sure to conduct thorough testing in a controlled environment and adapt the security measures to align with your specific organizational and deployment requirements.
